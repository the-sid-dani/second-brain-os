# Second-Brain OS

A personal AI workspace that runs on your computer. You talk to it naturally — it handles morning briefings, contacts, projects, meeting prep, research recall, design output, and more.

```
You:  "morning, what's on my plate today?"
You:  "tell me about Sarah"
You:  "I just spoke with Sarah about the launch"
You:  "do I have any notes on Q3 planning?"
You:  "let's start a new project for the product launch"
```

All routed automatically to the right pre-built workflow. No commands to memorize.

---

## What is this?

A workspace skeleton that turns Claude Code into your personal chief-of-staff (or research companion, engineering co-pilot, sales-ops assistant — you pick the persona during setup). You configure it once with your identity, then talk to the assistant normally. It routes your intent to the right pre-built workflow.

It's NOT a SaaS product, hosted service, or app. It's a folder on your Mac that Claude Code reads from. Your data never leaves your machine unless YOU send it somewhere (e.g., when you ask it to publish a Slack message, you're authorizing that one send).

---

## How it works

Three pieces fit together:

### 1. **Skills** — pre-built workflows in `.claude/skills/`

A skill is just a markdown file with frontmatter that tells Claude when to use it. The bundle ships 44 of them: `briefing` runs morning briefs, `contact` looks up people, `new-project` scaffolds projects, `design-saas-landing` renders HTML mockups, and so on. When you type *"morning, what's on my plate?"*, Claude reads every skill's description and picks the best match. You can also invoke a skill explicitly with `/briefing`, `/contact <name>`, etc.

**The one skill you'll always run first is `/bootstrap`.** It's the interactive setup that personalizes the OS to you — collects your name, role, workspace paths, persona name, design brand, then writes that into the Configuration section of `CLAUDE.md`. Everything else assumes `/bootstrap` has been run.

### 2. **A PARA workspace** at `<workspace.root>/`

PARA is a folder convention (Projects / Areas / Resources / Archive) borrowed from Tiago Forte. In this OS it means a fixed 6-folder layout under one root directory — that's where YOUR data lives (briefings, contacts, project notes, research, design files). The skills know how to navigate it because the folder names are referenced symbolically (`<workspace.projects>`, `<workspace.resources>`, etc.) in Configuration. See "[The PARA workspace](#the-para-workspace)" below for what each folder is for and why.

### 3. **Configuration tokens** in `CLAUDE.md`

One section in root `CLAUDE.md` holds your identity + paths as symbolic tokens (`<user.name>`, `<assistant.name>`, `<workspace.root>`, etc.). Skills resolve them at runtime. This is what makes the bundle portable — fork it, run `/bootstrap`, the tokens get filled in with YOUR values, and every skill adapts. No code changes needed.

### Two-stage setup — why there are two install steps

You may notice the install instructions below have a **shell command** (`./scripts/install.sh`) AND a **Claude Code command** (`/bootstrap`). That's intentional:

- **`./scripts/install.sh`** (shell, OPTIONAL) — installs OS-level tooling needed only by the power-user skills (`/research`, `/autonomous`, `/premortem`, `/review`). Skip it if you only want the chief-of-staff + design skills.
- **`/bootstrap`** (inside Claude Code, REQUIRED) — personalizes the OS to you. This is the meaningful setup step.

`/bootstrap` can't run in your shell — it's a Claude Code slash command, only available inside a Claude session. So the sequence is always: get to a Claude session in the right folder, then run `/bootstrap` from there.

---

## Install

The thing you're trying to reach is `/bootstrap` inside Claude Code. Everything before that is plumbing.

### Prerequisites (all paths)

- macOS 11+ (WSL2/Linux compatibility deferred)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- `git` on PATH (`xcode-select --install` if missing)
- Internet access

### Path A — Minimal (~5 min) — chief-of-staff + design only (knowledge-worker default)

For most fork users. The default installer tier — foundation toolchain + `.env.example` + tier marker. Skip the `--with-coding` flag entirely.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-sid-dani/second-brain-os ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
cd ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
./scripts/install.sh    # optional — installs missing foundation tools only (~3-5 min)
claude
```

If `gh`, `claude`, `jq`, and `node` are already on PATH, the installer skips foundation steps and just writes `.env.example` + the tier marker (`SBOS_TIER=minimal` → `~/.second-brain-os.env`). You can even skip `./scripts/install.sh` entirely and go straight to `claude` — `/bootstrap` will still work, it just won't have the tier marker (it'll assume minimal).

Inside the Claude Code session that opens, type `/bootstrap`. ~10-15 min interactive walkthrough — identity, persona, design brand, voice, workspace folders, optional MCP connectors (Slack / Atlassian / Figma — opt-in only).

You're done. Try *"morning, what's on my plate today?"* or *"let's start a new project for X"* to confirm.

### Path B — Coding (~15-20 min) — adds `/research`, `/autonomous`, `/premortem`, FastEdit MCP

If you want the power-user skills, opt into the coding tier with `--with-coding`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-sid-dani/second-brain-os ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
cd ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
./scripts/install.sh --with-coding                       # full coding tier (~15-20 min, ~5 GB)
# or, to skip the 3 GB FastEdit MLX merge model:
./scripts/install.sh --with-coding --no-fastedit-model   # ~10-15 min, ~500 MB
claude
```

`--with-coding` adds Rust, uv, the CCv4 binaries (`bloks`, `tldr-cli`), CCv4 Python deps for the Ouros harness, and the FastEdit MCP. The tier marker becomes `SBOS_TIER=coding` and `/bootstrap` Step 2 probes the full CCv4 toolchain.

Add `--with-ripgrep` if you want the faster `/find` skill (the `grep -r` fallback works without it). Both flags can stack with `--with-coding`.

**API keys**: the installer doesn't prompt. It writes an annotated `.env.example` to the repo root listing 7 optional keys (GEMINI, FIRECRAWL, ANTHROPIC, EXA, NIA, HF, ATLASSIAN) — each with a one-line description of what feature it unlocks. Claude Code itself uses OAuth on first run, so none of those keys are required to start. Copy to `.env` and fill in only what you need: `cp .env.example .env`. Note: MCPs read from your shell env (not `.env`), so for `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` also `export` them in `~/.zshrc`.

Then inside Claude: `/bootstrap` for identity setup. The default `.mcp.json` ships 3 universal MCPs (gemini-vision, exa, firecrawl) — zero red errors on first `/mcp`. Slack / Atlassian / Figma are opt-in: bootstrap Step 2.5 asks which connectors you use and appends them to `.mcp.json` interactively. Run `/mcp` after bootstrap to OAuth any connectors you added — standard browser flow; Slack uses Anthropic's published clientId (a Slack workspace admin approves it once).

On Apple Silicon, FastEdit runs locally via MLX. On Intel Macs, the MLX backend won't be hardware-accelerated.

### Tier comparison

| Path | Flag | What you get | Disk | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Minimal** (default) | (none) | Chief-of-staff + design skills, persona templates, 3 universal MCPs (gemini-vision/exa/firecrawl). Bootstrap Step 2.5 adds Slack/Atlassian/Figma if you opt in. | ~5 MB | ~3-5 min |
| **B: Coding** | `--with-coding` | Above + `/research`, `/autonomous`, `/premortem`, `/review`, bloks, tldr, Ouros REPL harness, FastEdit MCP (AST-aware code edits). | ~5 GB (or ~500 MB with `--no-fastedit-model`) | ~10-20 min |

You can upgrade later — re-run `./scripts/install.sh --with-coding` and it picks up where you left off (idempotent, additive). The tier marker (`SBOS_TIER`) gets updated to `coding` automatically and `/bootstrap` Step 2 will probe the new tools on next run.

### Why `cd` before `claude`

Claude Code loads skills + hooks by scanning the directory it was launched from. You must `cd` into the cloned folder **before** running `claude` — otherwise the session won't see `/bootstrap` or the other harness skills. If you forget, type `exit`, `cd` into the folder, run `claude` again.

### Re-running, upgrading, downgrading

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --no-fastedit-model  # skip the 3 GB model
./scripts/install.sh --verbose            # stream sub-command output
./scripts/install.sh --help               # full flag list
```

The installer is fully idempotent — re-run any time to pick up upgrades. It never prompts for API keys; those live in `.env` (see `.env.example` written at the end of install, or in this repo's root).

See `INSTALL.md` for step-by-step manual install (use if the installer fails mid-way or you maintain a non-standard toolchain).

### Alternative — chat through it with Claude

If you'd rather have a conversation than run terminal commands, here's a prompt to paste into any Claude Code session. **Note**: Claude can clone the repo and run `install.sh` for you, but it can't invoke `/bootstrap` — that's a slash command bound to the new session you'll open after install. This is a fundamental Claude Code constraint (skills load at session-start), not a limitation of the prompt.

1. Open Terminal and run `claude` to start any Claude Code session.

2. Paste this into Claude Code and hit Enter:

   ```
   Hi! I want to install the second-brain-os — a personal AI workspace.
   The public template is at: https://github.com/the-sid-dani/second-brain-os

   Please help me set this up. Walk me through these steps:

   1. Check what I have installed by running `git --version` and `claude --version`.
      If anything's missing, tell me how to install it on a Mac and pause until I confirm.

   2. Ask me which install tier I want — Minimal or Coding. Briefly explain
      the trade-offs (chief-of-staff + design only vs. + /research, /autonomous,
      /premortem, /review, FastEdit MCP) and the disk/time cost of each.

   3. Ask me where I want to clone the repo (default: ~/Desktop/second-brain-os).
      Clone it there for me, then cd into it.

   4. Run the installer for me:
        - Minimal:  `./scripts/install.sh`
        - Coding:    `./scripts/install.sh --with-coding`
                     (add `--no-fastedit-model` if I want to skip the 3 GB MLX model)

      The installer never prompts for API keys — it writes an annotated
      `.env.example` (7 optional keys) you can fill in later. Claude Code
      itself uses OAuth on first run, so none of the optional keys are
      needed to start. Tell me where the `.env.example` lives so I know
      where to look if I want to enable GEMINI / FIRECRAWL / EXA / NIA /
      Atlassian / HF / Anthropic-SDK features.

      Heads up: install.sh may ask for my sudo password ONCE (if Homebrew isn't
      installed yet) and will run many sub-commands (brew, npm, cargo, pip, uv).
      Claude Code may prompt me to approve each Bash command. That's expected.

   5. **Important honest handoff**: tell me you can't invoke /bootstrap from this
      session because Claude Code loads skills at session-start. Tell me to:
        - type `exit` to quit this Claude Code session
        - re-open Claude Code from the cloned folder (the path you just cloned into)
        - then type `/bootstrap` in that new session
        - bootstrap Step 2.5 will offer optional Slack/Figma/Atlassian MCPs —
          pick the ones I use; afterward run `/mcp` to OAuth them

      Don't pretend to run /bootstrap. The skill literally isn't available here.

   Treat me like a smart non-technical person — explain what each step does
   briefly, don't over-explain, and ask before doing anything destructive.
   ```

3. **Follow Claude's instructions** to clone the repo and (optionally) run the installer. When it's done, Claude will tell you to quit and re-open Claude Code in the cloned folder.

4. **Re-open Claude Code** in the cloned folder (Terminal: `cd ~/Desktop/second-brain-os && claude`), then type `/bootstrap`. Bootstrap Step 2.5 will offer optional Slack/Atlassian/Figma MCPs — pick the ones you use; afterward run `/mcp` to OAuth them.

5. **(Optional) Fill in `.env`** — only if you want to enable one of the 7 optional features (GEMINI / FIRECRAWL / EXA / NIA / Atlassian-uploads / FastEdit-model / Anthropic-SDK Python tools). The installer wrote an annotated `.env.example` at the repo root with one-line descriptions of each key. Copy it: `cp .env.example .env`, then edit. Nothing in `/bootstrap`, `/briefing`, or the design skills requires these. Note: for the MCP keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`) also `export` them in `~/.zshrc` — MCPs read from your shell env, not `.env`.

## The PARA workspace

When `/bootstrap` runs, it creates a folder tree at `<workspace.root>/` (default: `workspace/`). This is where YOUR content lives — projects, contacts, briefings, research, design files. The skills know how to navigate it.

### Why these folders, in this layout

PARA is Tiago Forte's framework (Projects / Areas / Resources / Archive) — see his book *Building a Second Brain* or Wikipedia for the generic theory. **In this OS specifically**, PARA means a fixed 6-folder layout:

| Folder | What goes in it | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `0-Inbox/` | Ad-hoc capture — anything not yet decided where it belongs | The friction-free landing zone. Stuff comes in here when you don't know if it's a project, a reference, or trash yet. `/inbox-process` triages it periodically (e.g., a Friday habit). |
| `1-Projects/` | Active projects — one folder per project | Time-bounded things with a defined outcome. Each gets its own `CLAUDE.md` + `memory.md`. Status frontmatter (`active`/`done`/`stale`) drives `/prune-projects` and `/archive-project`. |
| `2-Areas/` | Evergreen HQ workstations — one folder per area of responsibility | PARA's Areas tier. Ongoing, never-ending workstreams (vs. time-bounded projects). Starts empty; adopt HQs as you grow. Each is its own `<name>/` folder with `CLAUDE.md` + `memory.md` + `resources/`; bounded `1-Projects/` deposit durable artifacts here on completion. |
| `3-Coding/` | Code repos — one folder per repo | Each its own git repo, gitignored from outer git so dev work stays isolated. The one allowed INDEX file lives at `<workspace.resources>/code-projects.md` (auto-created by `/new-project`) because gitignored repos can't be discovered by frontmatter-grep. |
| `4-Resources/` | Inputs AND outputs colocated by type — templates, contacts, meetings, briefings, research, design-systems | The "library + filing cabinet" — reference material you didn't create + generated outputs (briefings, organization reports). Subfolders are domain-typed (`meetings/`, `briefings/`, `contacts/`, etc.) so outputs sit next to their inputs. |
| `5-Archive/` | Completed or stale work | The move-don't-delete graveyard. Old projects keep their `memory.md` so decision history survives. `/archive-project` moves things here and flips status frontmatter. |

The folder names are not arbitrary — they're referenced symbolically across every skill as Configuration tokens (`<workspace.projects>` resolves to `1-Projects/`, etc. — see `CLAUDE.md` Configuration section). If you fork this and rename them, edit the Configuration section to match; the skills will adapt.

**`2-Areas/` is the evergreen tier** — PARA's Areas, here used for HQ workstations: ongoing areas of responsibility that bounded `1-Projects/` deposit into on completion. A fresh fork starts with it empty; adopt HQs as recurring workstreams emerge (see the HQ model in `CLAUDE.md`). One folder per HQ, each with its own `CLAUDE.md` + `memory.md` + `resources/`.

### What `/bootstrap` does NOT touch

`/bootstrap` only creates the EMPTY folder skeleton + scaffolds the templates. It never writes content into `1-Projects/` (those come from `/new-project`) or `4-Resources/briefings/` (those come from `/briefing`). The skills own the content; `/bootstrap` owns the structure.

---

## What you can ask it to do

You don't have to memorize slash commands. Claude reads your prompt and the description of every installed skill, then picks the best match.

| You say | Auto-routes to |
|---|---|
| "morning, what's on my plate today?" | `/briefing` |
| "do I have research on prompt caching?" | `/find` |
| "what did I save about prompt caching?" | `/find` |
| "tell me about Alex" | `/contact` |
| "what's my context with Sarah again?" | `/contact` |
| "I just spoke with Alex about the launch" | `/contact-log` |
| "let's start a new project for Q3 planning" | `/new-project` |
| "spin up a repo for a new MCP server" | `/new-project` (code-repo branch) |
| "I'm done with the launch project" | `/archive-project` |
| "what's stale right now?" | `/prune-projects` |
| "make me a landing page for the launch" | `/design-saas-landing` |
| "draft a deck about the AI strategy" | `/design-simple-deck` |
| "build a dashboard mockup" | `/design-dashboard` |
| "save this article for later" | `/save-resource` |
| "process my inbox" | `/inbox-process` |
| "how does X work in this OS?" | `/os-guide` |

You can also type `/skill-name` directly if you know it — both work.

## Configuration — one section, all tokens

All identity + path values live in **one place** — the `## Configuration` section of `CLAUDE.md`. Skills read these tokens (`<user.name>`, `<workspace.root>`, etc.) symbolically and resolve them at runtime.

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `user.name` | Short name — "Morning Alex!", default stakeholder for new projects |
| `user.full_name` | Display name in formal docs |
| `user.email` | Email signature, calendar invites |
| `user.github` | Used by `/new-project` code-repo branch for `gh repo create` |
| `user.timezone` | Briefing date math, calendar formatting |
| `user.email_signature` | Block appended to emails the assistant drafts |
| `user.company` | Used in formal documents |
| `assistant.name` | Persona name — `<agent>` by default, customize to anything (Atlas, Echo, Sage, etc.) |
| `assistant.role` | "Chief of Staff" / "Research Companion" / "Engineering Co-Pilot" |
| `assistant.vibe` | One-line vibe descriptor for SOUL.md voice cues |
| `assistant.emoji` | Optional emoji for the persona |
| `workspace.root` | Default `workspace`; rename to `brain`, `<name>-workspace`, etc. |
| `workspace.inbox / projects / coding / resources / archive` | Subfolder names — defaults are 0-Inbox, 1-Projects, etc. |
| `setup_completed` | Date `/bootstrap` ran (presence = configured; absence = fresh fork) |

`/bootstrap` fills these in interactively. See `EXAMPLE-CONFIG.md` for what a completed Configuration looks like.

---

## Update Rules — "What goes where, when"

### Identity / persona files (root)

| File | When to update |
|------|----------------|
| `SOUL.md` | <assistant.name>'s voice, boundaries, or "how to be helpful" rules change |
| `USER.md` | <user.name>'s role, team, preferences shift. Always convert relative dates to absolute |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Version bumps, name changes. Rare |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific context only (output paths, briefing rules, Configuration tokens). Never restate SOUL/USER content |
| `TOOLS.md` | When the toolchain changes (new MCPs, new skills, CLI auth state shifts) |

### Memory — dual-folder model

Two memory folders, distinct roles. Both load at session start.

**Folder A — `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`** (auto-managed by Claude Code)
- Claude Code writes here when it learns a live preference, fact, or rule
- Indexed by `MEMORY.md` (uppercase)
- Per-machine; NOT in git

**Folder B — `memory/`** (in git, curated by <assistant.name> + <user.name>)
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — append-only daily log
- `memory/memory.md` (lowercase) — index of project memory contents (optional)
- `memory/writing-style.md` — <user.name>'s writing style profile (optional)
- `memory/learned-preferences.md` — durable preferences (optional)

**Save rule:** live preference → Folder A. Daily journal entry or curated long-form → Folder B. Never create a third memory location.

### Workspace (`<workspace.root>/`)

- New project (planning, strategy, content, research)? → `/new-project` scaffolds at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/YYYY-MM-slug/`
- New code repo? → `/new-project`, choose `code-repo` as project-type. Creates at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.coding>/<name>/`. Auto-appends to a `code-projects.md` index (which the skill creates on first invocation — fresh forks don't ship one)
- Reference doc, template, meeting prep, research dump? → `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/<topic>/`
- Ad-hoc / undecided capture? → `<workspace.root>/<workspace.inbox>/`
- Project complete? → `/archive-project` moves it to `<workspace.archive>/` and flips status frontmatter
- Stale projects need review? → `/prune-projects` (Friday-batch staleness review)

### Outputs

<assistant.name> writes briefings, meeting-prep, and organization-reports into dedicated subdirs of Resources (alongside `meetings/` raw transcripts — synthesis next to source). Naming:
- `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/meeting-prep/YYYY-MM-DD-<who-or-what>.md`
- `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/organization-reports/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

Never write outputs at the workspace root.

### What does NOT belong at root

- Project-specific drafts → `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/<project>/`
- One-off scripts → `<workspace.root>/<workspace.archive>/<context>/` or a code repo
- Reference data (CSVs, employee directories) → `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/reference/`
- Junk (`.DS_Store`, zips, log dumps) → delete

All read brand tokens from root `DESIGN.md` — swap with `/use-design <brand>` (72+ presets shipped). |

Each skill has its own `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file documenting what it does, trigger phrases, and process steps. Browse `.claude/skills/` to look around.

**MCPs — 3 universals shipped + 3 opt-in connectors.**

The default `.mcp.json` ships **3 universal MCPs** so your first `claude` launch shows zero red OAuth errors:

- `gemini-vision` — local image/video/document analysis using Google's free Gemini tier. Needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your shell env ([get one free](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)).
- `exa` — web search (account-bound HTTP auth, no key).
- `firecrawl` — web scrape/crawl. Needs `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` in your shell env ([get one](https://firecrawl.dev)).

**Three more are opt-in** — `/bootstrap` Step 2.5 asks which you use and appends them to `.mcp.json` (canonical entries live in `.mcp.json` `_notes.opt_in_*`). After bootstrap adds them, run `/mcp` to authorize via browser-OAuth:

- `slack` — read, send, search Slack messages (uses Anthropic's published Slack app clientId; a workspace admin approves once).
- `atlassian` — Jira tickets + Confluence pages.
- `figma` — read Figma designs and convert to code.

**Brand presets (72+).** Pre-built design systems at `workspace/4-Resources/design-systems/` — Airbnb, Stripe, Linear, Notion, Claude, Vercel, Tesla, BMW, Lamborghini, Spotify, and 60+ others. Switch the active brand with `/use-design <brand>` and every design-* skill renders in that style.

**Persona templates (6).** Generic SOUL / USER / IDENTITY / CLAUDE / README / TOOLS templates that `/bootstrap` fills in with your values.

**Hooks (8 + 2 libs).** PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Stop hooks wired in `.claude/settings.json`. Handle status line, structural code reads, post-edit diagnostics, auto-handoff on compaction, intent routing, external-action friction (Slack send, force-push, Atlassian writes, `rm -rf`).

## Recurring Work

Plain Claude Code primitives:

- **`CronCreate` / `CronList` / `CronDelete`** — schedule recurring agent runs at cron expressions
- **`/schedule`** — set up scheduled remote agents on a cron
- **`/loop`** — self-paced or interval-based recurring tasks
- **Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`) — event-driven automation (`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `PreCompact`)

## Quick reference

| I want to... | How |
|---|---|
| Understand how X works in this OS (PARA, Configuration, tools, skills, decisions) | `/os-guide` skill — reads canonical files live with file:line citations |
| Refresh `/os-guide` after adding new tools / skills / brands / decisions | `/os-guide --sync` — diffs filesystem against last sync, proposes routing updates, asks before applying |
| Know who <user.name> is | `USER.md` |
| Know who <assistant.name> is | `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` |
| See active projects (live, with staleness) | `bash <workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/templates/project-query.sh` |
| See unmigrated projects | `... project-query.sh --status all` |
| Scaffold a new project (work or code repo) | `/new-project` |
| Archive a finished project | `/archive-project` |
| Friday review of stale projects | `/prune-projects` |
| Find existing knowledge | `/find <topic>` |
| Look up a person | `/contact <name>` |
| Log an interaction | `/contact-log <name>` |
| Write a morning briefing | `/briefing` |
| Process the inbox | `/inbox-process` |
| Save something for later | `/save-resource` |
| Swap the active design brand | `/use-design <brand>` |
| Add a recurring task | `CronCreate` or `/schedule` |
| Reconfigure identity / persona | `/bootstrap` (delete `setup_completed:` line in CLAUDE.md first) |

## Want to back up your work to GitHub? (optional)

The simple install instructions above just clone the public repo to your computer. Your personal data (memory logs, briefings, contacts, projects) lives only on your Mac.

If you want a GitHub backup or want to use this on multiple computers, **fork** the repo instead. A fork is your own copy on GitHub that you can push to.

```bash
# Option 1: via the GitHub CLI
gh repo fork the-sid-dani/second-brain-os --clone --remote
cd second-brain-os
claude
/bootstrap

# Option 2: via the web
# Visit https://github.com/the-sid-dani/second-brain-os/fork and click "Create fork"
# Then clone YOUR fork:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/second-brain-os ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
cd ~/Desktop/second-brain-os
claude
/bootstrap
```

If you skipped this and want to add backup later, you can — just create a new private repo on GitHub and push your local copy to it.
