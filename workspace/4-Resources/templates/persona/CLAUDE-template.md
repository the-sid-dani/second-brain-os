# Second-Brain OS — Project Instructions for <assistant.name>

This file is project-scoped instructions only. **Persona, user, and tooling context live in dedicated files** — do not duplicate them here.

## Load Order at Session Start

1. **@SOUL.md** — <assistant.name>'s persona, voice, boundaries
2. **@USER.md** — <user.name>'s profile, role, communication preferences, team
3. **@IDENTITY.md** — <assistant.name>'s name, version, origin
4. **@TOOLS.md** — Available tools and capabilities
5. **@README.md** — Project map and update rules

If anything below conflicts with those files, those files win.

## Configuration — source of truth for skills

Skills (`/new-project`, `/archive-project`, `/prune-projects`, the intent-detector hook) read the values below as the source of truth. **To fork this workspace for your own use, run `/bootstrap`** — it walks through these values interactively and rewrites this section. Every skill references these paths and identity values symbolically (e.g., `<workspace.projects>`) and adapts automatically.

### workspace
- `workspace.root` = `<workspace.root>` (default: `workspace`; rename to `workspace`, `brain`, `<assistant>-workspace`, etc.)
- `workspace.inbox` = `0-Inbox`
- `workspace.projects` = `1-Projects`
- `workspace.areas` = `2-Areas` — evergreen HQ workstations (PARA Areas); starts empty, populate as you grow recurring workstreams (see HQ model below)
- `workspace.coding` = `3-Coding`
- `workspace.resources` = `4-Resources`
- `workspace.archive` = `5-Archive`

Resolved paths (combine the above): `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>` → e.g., `workspace/1-Projects`.

### templates (under `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/templates/`)
- `templates.project_claude` = `project-claude-template.md` — for non-code project CLAUDE.md
- `templates.project_memory` = `project-memory-template.md` — for any project's memory.md
- `templates.code_claude` = `code-project-claude-template.md` — for code-repo project CLAUDE.md
- `templates.persona` = `persona/` — for persona file templates (used by `/bootstrap`)

### indexes
- `indexes.code_projects` = `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/code-projects.md` — the one allowed index file

### scripts
- `scripts.project_query` = `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/templates/project-query.sh`

### user
- `user.name` = `<user.name>` — short name; default stakeholder for new projects, voice cues ("Morning <user.name>!")
- `user.full_name` = `<user.full_name>` — full display name
- `user.email` = `<user.email>`
- `user.timezone` = `<user.timezone>`
- `user.github` = `<user.github>` — used by `/new-project`'s code-repo branch for `gh repo create <user.github>/<name> --private`
- `user.email_signature` = `<user.email_signature>`
- `user.company` = `<user.company>`

### assistant
- `assistant.name` = `<assistant.name>` — referenced in SKILL.md prose via `<assistant.name>` placeholder so skills don't hardcode the persona name. Skills auto-substitute when SKILL.md auto-loads.
- `assistant.role` = `<assistant.role>` — short role descriptor (e.g., "Chief of Staff", "Research Companion", "Engineering Co-Pilot")
- `assistant.vibe` = `<assistant.vibe>` — one-line vibe descriptor used in SOUL.md voice cues
- `assistant.emoji` = `<assistant.emoji>`

### lifecycle
- `setup_completed` = `<YYYY-MM-DD>` — date `/bootstrap` ran successfully. Used as the re-run gate (presence = configured; missing/empty = fresh fork). To re-run `/bootstrap`, delete this line first.

### Forking note

When someone clones this repo to use as their own second-brain OS:
1. Run `/bootstrap` — interactive setup that fills in the values above and (optionally) rewrites the persona files (SOUL, USER, IDENTITY) from templates at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/templates/persona/`
2. Optionally rename `<workspace.root>/` to whatever feels right and update `workspace.root` to match
3. After `/bootstrap`: try `/briefing` for a morning brief, `/find <topic>` to recall, `/help` for the full skill list

The skills themselves shouldn't need code changes for a fork — the only hardcoded paths in them are Claude Code's own (`.claude/hooks/`, `~/.claude/projects/...`), which are framework-level.

---

## HQ / Active Project model

The core organizational pattern of the OS. **A fresh fork ships with zero HQs** — the `<workspace.areas>/` folder starts empty. You grow into HQs as recurring, long-running workstreams emerge; a completed project deposits its durable artifacts into one.

**HQ = evergreen workstation.** Each `<workspace.areas>/<name>/` is a PARA Area (peer to `<workspace.projects>/`) — a workstation that accumulates monotonically: strategy, playbooks, durable artifacts for one long-running area of responsibility. It grows from completed projects, never empties, and is owned indefinitely. Each HQ holds its own `CLAUDE.md` + `memory.md` + `resources/`.

**Active Project = bounded current execution.** Each `<workspace.projects>/<slug>/` is in-flight tactical work — it has a start, an end, and (recommended) a `parent_hq:` it deposits into when it completes. Tactical state lives here while alive (this week's data, drafts, notes). **If it's in `<workspace.projects>/`, it's active. If it's not active, it's not there.** `parent_hq:` takes the bare HQ name (e.g., `parent_hq: client-work`, not `parent_hq: 2-Areas/client-work`) — skills prepend `<workspace.areas>/` themselves.

**HQ routing — progressive, load-on-demand.** Never pre-load all HQs at session start. Keep a **routing-map table** in `memory.md` that maps task type → HQ. At the start of each user turn (or whenever the task shifts), consult the routing map, match the task against the trigger column, and load **only the matched HQ's** `CLAUDE.md` + `memory.md`. When no row matches, work from root context alone. When two rows match, load the primary HQ (the noun of the task) and reference the secondary's rules only as needed. This is progressive context loading — load the minimum needed for the task in front of you.

**Completion ritual** (enforced by `/archive-project`):
1. Promote durable artifacts from the project into the parent HQ at `<workspace.areas>/<name>/` — with a freshness check on every file moved (stale-on-promotion pollutes the evergreen OS).
2. Archive the tactical residue (drafts, raw data) to `<workspace.archive>/<slug>/`.
3. Flip project frontmatter `status: active` → `done`.
4. Append a one-line entry to the project's `memory.md` noting what got promoted vs archived.

**`parent_hq:` is recommended on every active project.** `parent_hq: none` is a smell — it means the project has no evergreen OS to deposit into when it completes. Either rescope under an existing HQ, or scaffold a new HQ if the workstream is genuinely evergreen.

## Documentation maintenance (4 load-bearing rules)

Prevents the stale-doc-graveyard pattern — multiple versions of the same doc coexisting, confusing both you and the assistant.

1. **One canonical filename per artifact. No version suffixes.** Edit `PLAN.md`, never create `PLAN-V2.md`. Git history is the version log. Frozen stakeholder snapshots go to `_snapshots/<doc>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, named by date, not version number.
2. **Supersede = move out same day.** When a doc is replaced, the predecessor moves to `_archive/` (folder-local) or `<workspace.archive>/` (workspace-level) in the same commit as the lock. No `status: superseded` files sitting next to current canonical ones.
3. **Every folder with 5+ canonical docs gets a `README.md` pointer.** Top of README names the canonical files. Everything else in the folder is reference or history.
4. **The lock ritual updates the index.** Locking a new canonical version in the same commit: (a) edit or rename the canonical file (no version suffixes — rule 1), (b) update the authoritative-docs pointer in the relevant CLAUDE.md/README, (c) move the predecessor per rule 2. If any is missing, the lock isn't done.

**Before citing any doc as canonical**, check (a) the filename is not version-suffixed, (b) frontmatter `status:` is `active` or `locked` (not `superseded`/`draft`), (c) it lives outside `_archive*/` and `<workspace.archive>/`. If any check fails, it's not canonical regardless of how authoritative it sounds.

## Naming conventions

Follow these when creating any new file / folder / project — they keep the workspace greppable and prevent drift. Before creating any new path, check it against the list; if a proposed path would violate one, correct it first.

- `lowercase-kebab.md` for working docs, plans, trackers.
- `UPPERCASE-KEBAB.md` ONLY for the closed set of OS files (CLAUDE / SOUL / USER / IDENTITY / README / TOOLS / CHANGELOG). No additions without versioning this standard.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` date-prefix only when the date is load-bearing (meeting notes, briefings, dated snapshots).
- `YYYY-MM-<slug>/` for project folders in `<workspace.projects>/`.
- `NN-<topic>.md` numeric prefix only when sequence carries meaning.
- `lowercase-kebab/` for code repos in `<workspace.coding>/` — no version suffix in repo names.
- HQ subfolders follow the same rules as the root workspace.
- `_archive/` and `_snapshots/` use the underscore prefix; machine-managed state uses a `.dot-prefix/`.
- Max 3 levels of nesting.
- Projects scaffold with a base 3 subdirs (`inputs/` + `working/` + `outputs/`); type-specific subfolders emerge lazily, not up front.

## Project-Specific Context

For Memory System (dual-folder), Workspace (PARA layout), and Outputs conventions, see **README.md** — that's the canonical source. This file holds only the project-specific deltas below.

### Briefing & report outputs

<assistant.name> writes to `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/meeting-prep/`, `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/organization-reports/`. Never write outputs at the workspace root. Never mix briefings with project files.

### OS knowledge skill — consult `/os-guide` before answering OS-shaped questions from memory

When the user asks an OS-shaped question — workspace paths, Configuration token values, what skills exist, how memory works, contacts schema, locked decisions, Operating Principles, tool inventory — **invoke `/os-guide` instead of answering from memory.** Memory drifts; the canonical source files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, etc.) don't. `/os-guide` reads them live, returns the answer with file:line citations, and resolves Configuration tokens at every invocation so paths reflect the actual fork. Specifically — Claude SHOULD self-consult before writing any of the following into a user-facing response: a workspace path, a Configuration value, a schema field, a claim about a skill's behavior, or a claim about a tool's connection state. After adding new tools/skills/brands/decisions to the OS, run `/os-guide --sync` to refresh its routing table. Read-only by default; `--sync` is the only mutation mode, gated behind explicit approval.

### Contacts (per-person reference directory)

Per-person tracking lives at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/<slug>.md`. **Schema, frontmatter fields, body sections, and conventions** are documented at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/README.md` — single source of truth.

The journal of any specific interaction lands in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; the durable per-person directory lives in Resources. Skills: `/contact` (read), `/contact-log` (append interaction). Pending: `/contact-add`, `/contact-update`, `/contact-enrich`, `/contact-audit`, `/contact-research`.

### Cross-references — WikiLinks convention

Reference one note from another with `[[topic]]` or `[[path/to/note]]` syntax. Manual convention — no tool enforces it. `/find` follows `[[X]]` links to surface related notes. Future-proof for Obsidian if <user.name> ever opens the vault there. Use the topic slug, not the full filename.

---

## Briefing & Synthesis Rules (<assistant.name>-Specific)

These extend SOUL.md — do not restate SOUL guidance here, only project-specific deltas.

**For morning briefings:**
- Cross-reference email + calendar + meeting notes before writing — don't summarize one source in isolation
- Apply <user.name>'s priority signals (see USER.md): direct collaborators, calendar conflicts, priority topics
- Pull SPECIFIC action items from meeting transcripts — names, timelines, blockers — never "follow up generically"
- Briefings go to `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/`, not the conversation only

**For meeting prep:**
- Always check the Recordings folder first if `<user.name>` has one configured (Gemini summaries are pre-condensed)
- Fall back to Transcripts folder if no recording exists
- Surface what <user.name> promised in past meetings with the same person

**For writing in <user.name>'s voice:**
- Load `memory/writing-style.md` before drafting strategic docs (if it exists — `<user.name>` writes their style profile here)
- Quantify everything (metrics, percentages, ROI)
- Use 🟢🟡🔴 status indicators in trackers; NO emojis in formal external docs

## Active Project Index — query at session start

Don't hardcode the project list here; it goes stale. Run the query script to get a live tabular view (status, project-type, days-since-touched, stale flag):

```bash
bash <workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/templates/project-query.sh
```

Default lists active projects sorted by staleness. Useful flags:
- `--status all` — also surface unmigrated projects (folders without `CLAUDE.md`) flagged `NEEDS_SCAFFOLD`
- `--tsv` — tab-separated, no header, for piping
- `--stale-days 60` — adjust the staleness threshold

For code projects (gitignored, not visible to the script), see `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/code-projects.md` — this file is auto-created by `/new-project` on first code-repo scaffold; fresh forks do not ship it.

---

## Boundaries (Project-Specific)

- **Do not auto-send messages** to Slack, email, Telegram, or WhatsApp without explicit "send it" from <user.name>. Drafts are fine.
- **Do not modify `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/`** files without asking — those are <user.name>'s working drafts.
- **Memory writes are append-only** under `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Don't rewrite history.
- **For destructive ops** (delete, force, reset): ask first, even if previously authorized for one task.
