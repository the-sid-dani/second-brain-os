# Contacts

Per-person reference directory. One file per person, slug-named (`jordan-chen.md`, `alex-rivera.md`). No date prefix — people aren't time-bounded.

## Why this exists

For <assistant.name> to track commitments obsessively (per SOUL.md), it needs to know:
- **Who** the user talks to (identity, role, relationship)
- **What** was discussed and promised (interaction log + open commitments)
- **When** they last interacted (recency for "you haven't talked in a while" surfacing)
- **Context** about them (background, expertise, recurring topics)

Without this, `/briefing`'s "Open commitments by person" section is shallow and `/meeting-prep` can't surface "what did you promise X last time."

## Why Resources, not memory/

Contacts are **reference material** (entity-keyed lookup) — same shape as `meetings/`, `reference/`, `research/`, `design-systems/`. They're NOT "stuff <assistant.name> learns about <user.name>" — that's `memory/` (daily logs, writing-style.md, learned-preferences.md).

The journal of any specific interaction lands in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The durable per-person directory lives here.

## Per-file schema

## About
Free-form context — background, expertise, things <user.name> wants surfaced when this name comes up. Update over time.

**Capture texture, not just facts**. The highest-value About content is judgment a directory can never hold — work these angles in as they become known, as prose or mini-subsections for Tier-1 relationships:
- *What they believe* — first principles, hills they die on
- *What they're building / what motivates them* — current focus, career arc
- *Hobby horses* — topics they return to obsessively
- *Trajectory* — ascending, plateauing, pivoting?
A LinkedIn-shaped About is a wasted About. Never overwrite <user.name>'s own written assessments with directory or API boilerplate.

## How <assistant.name> uses these

- **`/contact <name>`** (Pass 4 #34) — fuzzy-match → display profile + last interaction + open commitments. Composes `/find` to surface mentions across projects/meetings/research.
- **`/contact-log <name>`** (Pass 4 #35) — append a new interaction entry to the log section; auto-bumps `last_interaction` frontmatter.
- **`/contact-add <name>`** (Pass 4 #35) — scaffold a new contact file from a prompt; optional `--enrich` flag pulls Workspace directory data via `gws-people`.
- **`/contact-audit`** (Pass 4 #36) — scans daily logs + meetings/ for names mentioned ≥2× but missing from contacts/, asks if they should be added.
- **`/briefing`** (Pass 3 #16) — reads contacts/ for the "Open commitments by person" section.
- **`/meeting-prep`** (Pass 3 #17) — reads the relevant contact file before generating prep.
- **`/find`** — already indexes contacts/ as part of resources/ scope (decision #18).

## WikiLinks

Daily logs and project notes reference contacts as `[[contacts/<slug>]]` so `/find` traces the relationship graph. Example in a daily log: "Met with [[contacts/jordan-chen]] re: platform architecture."

## Maintenance

- **Every contact needs `first_logged` + `last_interaction` minimum** in frontmatter for `/contact-audit` to work.
- **Append to the Interaction log; never rewrite.** Same rule as project memory.md.
- **Commitments carry dates and expire**. Every Open-commitments line keeps the `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD — what — by YYYY-MM-DD` shape: origin date AND due date. When a commitment resolves, check it off (`- [x]`) and leave it in place (history). When one goes stale — past due with no follow-up for 30+ days — don't silently delete: mark it `- [~] ... — STALE YYYY-MM-DD` so `/briefing` stops surfacing it but the record shows it was dropped, not done. A commitments section full of undated or zombie lines is how "track commitments obsessively" quietly dies.
- **Meeting entity propagation**. When a meeting note or transcript is processed (briefing prep, meeting-prep, manual notes) and a contact with a file made a commitment or decision in it, that contact's file gets the touch — via `/contact-log` — in the same working session, not "later". A meeting that updates only `meetings/` and not the people in it is a half-filed meeting.
- **Status `inactive`** when someone leaves the company or stops being relevant — keeps the file for historical record but `/briefing` and `/contact-audit` skip them.
- **Status `external`** for people outside <user.company> in a business context (vendors, candidates, peer-company contacts, partners).
- **Status `personal`** for non-business contacts: friends, family, side-project collaborators, anyone outside the work scope. `/briefing` and other work-context skills should filter `status: personal` out by default. **Privacy note:** personal contact data lives in a git-tracked file — capture only what's appropriate to commit.

## Source of truth

If your organization has an authoritative directory (Workspace directory, HR records, employee export), use it for `role`, `department`, `division`, `location`, `work_phone`, `reports_to`. Directory data may have stale team names — the canonical `team` field stays in the contact file; the directory's `department` is captured separately.
