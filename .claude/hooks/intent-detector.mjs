/**
 * intent-detector.mjs — UserPromptSubmit hook v1 (LOG-ONLY)
 *
 * Item 7 of Pass 2c. Reads the user's prompt from stdin, regex-tests it
 * against a narrow set of project-lifecycle trigger patterns, and if any
 * match, appends a JSONL entry to .claude/intent-detector-log.jsonl. NEVER
 * injects context; NEVER blocks; ALWAYS exits 0.
 *
 * After 7 days of logging, audit the JSONL — true-positive rate, missed
 * triggers, false positives — then tune the regex set and ship v2 (item 8)
 * which keeps the same matching but ALSO emits additionalContext to suggest
 * the right slash command in-line.
 *
 * Why narrow first: a chatty hook trains the user to ignore suggestions.
 * A silent
 * v1 lets us measure precision/recall on real traffic without polluting the
 * conversation. Once we know which patterns fire correctly, v2 only suggests
 * on the high-precision ones.
 *
 * Failure modes are silent on purpose — a hook that errors loudly on every
 * prompt is worse than one that silently no-ops. Any uncaught error → exit 0.
