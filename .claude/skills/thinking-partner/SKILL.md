# thinking-partner

Mode skill, not a generator. Flips <assistant.name>'s default disposition from "try to solve" to "ask questions to understand the problem first". The output isn't a file — it's a more clarified user.

**Before you begin: read the Configuration section in root CLAUDE.md.** Path tokens like `<workspace.resources>` resolve from there.

## Why this exists

<assistant.name>'s default disposition is to answer. When the user says "should we use approach A or B?", <assistant.name> jumps straight to a comparison. That's right when the user already knows what they want. It's wrong when the user is still figuring out what the actual problem is — a premature answer locks them in before clarification.

This skill is a habit-flip: when triggered, <assistant.name> *deliberately* doesn't solve. It asks. The reason this earns its keep: the user has often pushed back during this very project's design sessions for exactly this reason ("you're jumping to solutions, slow down"). A slash command formalizes the correction so it doesn't depend on conversational discipline.

Distinct from `/brainstorm` (a global skill — divergent idea-generation, "give me 10 options"). This skill is *convergent through clarification* — it narrows the problem space, not expands it. Route bare divergent option-generation requests to `/brainstorm`; own "brainstorm" only when ambiguity / stuck / "help me decide" signals are present.

## When to use

Trigger phrases (broad — exploration is the pattern, not the literal command):

- "let's think through X" / "help me think about X"
- "help me explore Y" / "explore this with me"
- "be a thinking partner" / "be a sounding board" / "talk me through this"
- "I'm not sure what to do about Z" / "I'm stuck on Z"
- "I want to noodle on V" / "let me noodle on this"
- "should we do A or B?" *only when followed by ambiguity signals* like "I don't know which", "what do you think", "I haven't decided"
- "let's brainstorm" — despite the name, the user usually means clarification, not divergence; trigger this skill when ambiguity/stuck signals are present, and if they explicitly want divergent option-generation ("give me N options"), hand off to `/brainstorm`
- "/thinking-partner"

Do NOT trigger for:
- Clear factual questions ("what's the syntax for X?", "where's file Y?") — answer directly.
- Code generation requests ("write me a script that does Z") — generate.
- Explicit recommendation requests ("recommend an approach", "tell me what to do") — recommend.
- Resume of prior decision threads ("ok let's continue with the plan we made") — continue, don't re-explore.

Boundary heuristic: if the user gives ambiguity signals ("not sure", "stuck", "don't know"), trigger. If they give decisiveness signals ("just do it", "what's the answer", "tell me"), skip the skill.

## Process

The skill is conversational. Subagent runs (no `AskUserQuestion`, no chat back-and-forth) should treat the invocation prompt as the entire context and produce a single structured exploration response.

### Step 1: Acknowledge mode + announce the rules — detect Problem vs Plan

Two sub-modes auto-detected from the user's framing:

**PROBLEM MODE** — the user has a half-formed *problem*. They're trying to figure out what they're actually wrestling with. Triggers: "stuck", "not sure", "noodle", "explore", "think through". Use Steps 3a (5 abstract dimensions) below.

**PLAN MODE** — the user has a half-formed *plan*. The shape exists but decisions are unresolved or dependencies aren't walked. Triggers: "interrogate this", "stress-test", "walk the design tree", "/grill-me", "I haven't thought through X". Use Steps 3b (design-tree walk) below.

Open with a one-liner that names the mode:

- **Problem mode:** *"Let's think through it. I'll ask first, solve later — say 'ok solve it' when you want me to switch."*
- **Plan mode:** *"Grill mode. I'll walk every branch of the design tree, you resolve each dependency. Say 'enough' to exit early."*

This is the contract. The user knows which mode we're in and how to exit.

### Step 2: Active context gathering (read first, then ask)

**This is the load-bearing step.** A "thinking partner" that asks abstract questions when the data is sitting one Read away is just an interview bot. Before any question goes to the user, pull the relevant raw material. Default to MORE tool use, not less.

Sources to actively read (in priority order):

1. **Project files in scope** — if the topic names a project (`/contact`, `/find`, the conversation already references `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/<slug>/`), Read its `CLAUDE.md`, `memory.md`, and any obvious deliverable docs (`system-design.md`, etc.). Don't skim — actually pull the relevant section into the question.
2. **Task / commitment state** — if the topic is task/commitment-shaped, query whatever live task source you have wired (a task tracker, an issue board) before asking "what's outstanding". Never ask the user to enumerate what a tool can fetch in 2 seconds.
3. **Vault search via `/find`** — only when the topic is unfamiliar or cross-project. Skip when files in scope already cover it.
4. **Memory files** — `memory/MEMORY.md` index + day logs from the last week, check for prior decisions on this topic before re-litigating.
5. **Calendar / meetings / Slack** — if the topic is people/meeting-shaped, probe via `gws` / Slack MCP before asking "who's involved".

**The rule**: every question you ask should reference SPECIFIC content you just read. Bad: *"What's the time commitment?"* Good: *"Q1 playbook says 2hrs/wk per champion (line 47). Has the offsite changed that?"* The user's brain shouldn't have to retrieve what your tools can.

If no relevant data exists, say so explicitly: *"I checked `1-Projects/`, Notion, and last week's memory — no prior notes on this. Fresh thinking."* Never fabricate context.

Don't dump raw tool output. Synthesize into the *next question*.

### Step 3: Ask via AskUserQuestion (default) — free-text only by exception · PROBLEM MODE branch
*(Skip to Step 3-PLAN below if Step 1 detected Plan Mode.)*

**Default surface: `AskUserQuestion` with 2-4 concrete options per question, one option marked Recommended.** Plain free-text questions are a *fallback*, not the norm. Why: typing a paragraph reply is friction; clicking an option that already exists is momentum. The user came here to think, not to draft essays.

**Construct each question with real material from Step 2.** Every option should be a hypothesis grounded in what you just read — not abstract framing. The user's job is to confirm / reject / branch, not to invent the option set.

Question dimensions to pick from (pick 3-5, adapt to topic):

1. **Anchor the problem** — what are we solving? Options = 3-4 concrete problem framings drawn from Step 2 data.
2. **Identify the constraint** — what's the real bottleneck? Options = candidates you spotted (e.g., "Time", "Budget sign-off", "Stakeholder buy-in", "Tooling gap").
3. **Surface the user** — who decides? Options = named people from contacts/USER.md.
4. **Probe assumptions** — what are we taking for granted? Options = 2-3 assumptions you can list (with "All hold" / "None hold" as escape valves).
5. **Imagine success** — what does "done" look like? Options = success-signal scenarios (e.g., "X people signed up", "Y approved the plan", "Z artifact shipped").
6. **Branch the direction** — when 2-3 viable paths exist, ask which. Options = the paths themselves with preview text showing what each entails.

**When to use free-text instead** (genuine exceptions, not defaults):
- The question is genuinely open-ended ("what landed at the offsite?") and any 4 options would constrain the answer wrong.
- You need a specific datum (a name, a date, a number).
- The user has already started typing context-rich replies — match their cadence.

**Use `preview` field aggressively.** When options carry concrete artifacts (a plan shape, a date sequence, an outreach list), put the literal content in `preview` so the user reads side-by-side instead of imagining. Side-by-side comparison is the highest-leverage feature this tool has.

**Multi-question batches** — `AskUserQuestion` accepts up to 4 questions per turn. Use 2-3 when they're tightly coupled (e.g., "approach" + "timeline" + "scope"). Single-question turns are fine for surgical decisions.

**Anti-patterns**:
- Asking a question the user has already answered in the framing — Read carefully first.
- Free-text where options would work — the default lazy move; resist.
- Generic options ("Yes / No / Maybe") — option text should carry the actual hypothesis content.
- Asking before reading — Step 2 is non-optional. Even a 30-second `Read` on the relevant `memory.md` beats a blank question.

### Step 3-PLAN: Design-tree walk · PLAN MODE branch
*(Skip if Step 1 detected Problem Mode.)*

The contract for Plan Mode (preserved verbatim from Matt Pocock's grill-me skill):

> *"Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one by one. And finally, if a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead."*

**3-PLAN.a — Build the tree privately:**
Read the user's plan. Identify:
- **Root node:** the top-level decision (e.g., "build an internal team portal")
- **Branches:** each major sub-decision that depends on the root (e.g., "single-page vs multi-page", "what sections", "auth-gated or public", "where it lives", "who owns it")
- **Sub-branches:** decisions that depend on each branch

Don't show the full tree upfront — overwhelming. Walk it one branch at a time.

**3-PLAN.b — Walk each branch:**
1. **Check the codebase first.** If the answer is already in code/memory/contacts/project docs, READ it: *"Looking at X.md line 47, I see Y — does that still apply?"*
2. **If codebase doesn't answer, ask the user** via AskUserQuestion with 2-4 options grounded in context.
3. **Wait for the answer.** Don't proceed down the branch until this node resolves.
4. **Surface dependencies.** *"OK, you picked X — that means we now need to decide Y, because Y depends on X."*
5. **Move to the next branch.**

**3-PLAN.c — No question cap.**
Plan Mode walks until the tree converges. Don't artificially cap at 5 questions like Problem Mode does. The tree decides the length.

**3-PLAN.d — Tree-state recap (instead of Step 6 synthesis):**
After 4-5 resolved branches, show the tree-state:

```
Decisions locked:
- Site type: multi-page docs site
- Audience: internal team only (auth-gated)
- Hosting: team-portal.example.com (new repo)

Branches still to walk:
- [ ] Page structure (home / what-you-get / curriculum / apply)
- [ ] Application form integration (embed vs link out)
- [ ] Update cadence

Continue, or done?
```

If user says "continue", walk next branches. If "done", remaining branches become "open questions for later" — don't pretend they resolved.

### Step 4: Track insights as we go

After each user response, briefly summarize what's emerging:

> *"OK so the constraint is [X], and you've already tried [Y] — what about [Z angle]?"*

This isn't synthesis yet — it's a checkpoint. Confirms understanding, shows the conversation is going somewhere, surfaces things the user said implicitly. Keep these short (2-3 lines max).

### Step 5: Surface contradictions explicitly

If the user's responses contradict each other, or contradict something in the vault context, **call it out**:

> *"You said earlier that X is the priority, but now Y sounds load-bearing — which is it, or are these the same thing?"*

This is the most valuable thing the skill does. Most decision-paralysis comes from unsurfaced contradictions. Naming them is half the fix.

### Step 6: Periodic synthesis

After 3-4 exchanges, offer a synthesis (don't wait for the user to ask):

```
Here's what I'm hearing so far:
- The actual problem is: <one sentence>
- The constraint is: <one sentence>
- What you've ruled out: <bullet>
- Open questions: <1-2 things still unclear>

Does that match what you're thinking, or am I off?
```

Synthesis lets the user course-correct or confirm. If they confirm, we're approaching the exit point. If they correct, we revise.

### Step 7: Wait for exit signal

Stay in mode until the user explicitly says one of:
- "ok solve it" / "now solve it" / "let's solve it"
- "I'm ready" / "I think I'm ready"
- "let's go" / "now do it"
- "now what?" / "what's next?"
- "give me your recommendation"

Do NOT exit mode just because *we* think the problem is clear. The user owns the exit decision. If they keep asking, keep clarifying. Exploration is allowed to take a while.

If after ~10 exchanges the user hasn't signaled exit and seems to be going in circles, gently surface this: *"We've been exploring for a bit — want me to recap where we are and offer my read, or keep digging?"* — that's a soft exit prompt without forcing it.

### Step 8: On exit — recommendation + optional save

When the user signals exit:

1. **Solve.** Provide the recommendation / answer / approach, drawing on everything that emerged in the exploration.
2. **Cite the exploration.** "Given what we just clarified — that the real constraint is X, that you've ruled out Y — my recommendation is Z because ..."
3. **Offer to save.** If the exploration produced something durable (a decision, a clarified problem statement, a list of options ruled out), offer:
   > *"Want me to save this as a memory entry, or append to a project's memory.md?"*
   - If user says memory: append to `memory/<today>.md` with a brief synthesis.
   - If user says project: ask which project, then append to `<workspace.projects>/<slug>/memory.md`.
   - If user says no: end cleanly, no file write.

Don't auto-save without asking — exploration sometimes produces nothing worth keeping, and the user knows best.

### Multi-turn discipline (turn 4 onwards)

The eval validated turns 1-4 well. The risk zone is **turn 5 onwards**, where the model's default disposition (try to solve) reasserts itself if not actively held in check. Specific rules for later turns:

**Turn 4-6 (mid-exploration):**
- Each new user response gets a brief insight checkpoint (Step 4) — never just another question stacked on top.
- After turn 4 (i.e., 3 user responses in), offer a Step 6 synthesis without waiting to be asked. Frame it as a check ("does that match?") so the user can correct course.
- If the user's last 2 responses contradict each other or prior context, surface the contradiction (Step 5) — don't paper over it.

**Turn 7+ (deep exploration):**
- The risk grows that the model drifts back to default solving. Active counter: re-state mode at every Step 6 synthesis ("Still in exploration mode — want to keep going or close out?").
- Resist generating recommendations even if internal reasoning has converged. The user owns exit; exploration *can* go 15 turns and that's fine.

**Anti-patterns at later turns:**
- Smuggling a recommendation inside a "synthesis" — if the synthesis ends with "so I'd suggest X", it's not a synthesis, it's a premature exit. Don't.
- Asking the same question rephrased — if user is going in circles, that's signal to use the soft-exit prompt from Step 7, not to keep extracting.
- Fabricating things the user said — every cited statement in synthesis MUST be traceable to an actual user message in this conversation. If you can't quote it, don't claim it.

**Synthesis fabrication check:** before writing a synthesis line that starts with "you said…" or "your concern is…", confirm the user actually said that thing. Paraphrase is fine; invention is not.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| User wants quick answer | Skill triggered when it shouldn't have | Exit immediately: *"sounds like you want the answer, not exploration — here's my read: [solve directly]"* |
| Vault search returns nothing | Fresh topic, no prior context | Proceed without — say *"I don't see prior notes on this — fresh thinking"*. Not a failure, just a state. |
| User goes silent / one-word answers | Disengaged or confused | Don't fill the void with more questions. Offer: *"Want me to summarize where we are and you can tell me if I've got it?"* — short-circuits to synthesis. |
| User keeps asking *us* clarifying questions back | Reverse exploration | They're using us as a sounding board for *us*. Answer their question briefly, redirect: *"My take is [X]. Does that change how you see it?"* |
| Going in circles after 10+ exchanges | No actual decision to make, or decision is blocked on info we can't get | Soft exit per Step 7 — surface this and offer recap. |
| `AskUserQuestion` not available (subagent context) | Worker subagents lack the tool | Treat the invocation prompt as the entire context. Produce a single structured response: brief vault-context check + 3 hypotheses about what the user is wrestling with + the 3-5 questions you'd ask if interactive. Don't try to fake a multi-turn conversation. |
| Configuration values missing | Fresh fork | Error: *"Configuration section in root CLAUDE.md not populated. Run `/bootstrap` (TBD) or fill it in manually first."* |

## Output format

This skill produces conversation, not files (unless Step 8 saves). The expected pattern across a session:

1. Mode acknowledgment (one line)
2. *(implicit)* `/find` call for vault context
3. 3-5 clarifying questions (across multiple turns)
4. Insight checkpoints after user responses
5. Periodic synthesis (after 3-4 exchanges)
6. Exit recommendation + optional memory save

The transcript IS the artifact. If saved, the synthesis from Step 6 + the recommendation from Step 8 become the durable record.
