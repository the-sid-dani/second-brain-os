  Morning chief-of-staff briefing — composes available signal sources (email, calendar, messaging, issue-tracking, code-hosting) plus local sources (contacts, active projects, USER.md priorities) into one self-contained HTML brief at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html`.

# briefing

The chief-of-staff morning brief. Probes which signal sources are available, composes only the ones present, and assembles a single structured document at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. Applies the user's priority signals, surfaces what needs them today, and recommends what to ship from each active project. Closes with a "Tools used" footer section transparently listing what was composed vs what was not configured — fork users with zero MCPs still get a useful brief from workspace state alone.

**Before you begin: read the Configuration section in root CLAUDE.md.** Path tokens like `<workspace.resources>` and `<scripts.project_query>` resolve from there — don't hardcode.

**Progressive disclosure — load on demand:**
- `references/html-composition.md` — full Step 9 HTML spec (DOM scaffold, canonical color fallbacks, hard rules, voice, section-omission, pre-Write assertions). **Load before composing the HTML.**
- `references/output-format.md` — the stable DOM contract (fixed section order + `data-od-id` slugs + gating behavior).
- `references/failure-modes.md` — symptom → cause → fix table for every known failure.

## Why this exists

<user.name> wants <assistant.name> to be a chief-of-staff, not a search engine. The morning brief is the single highest-value moment of the day: cross-referencing whatever signal sources are configured (email, calendar, messaging, issue-tracking, code-hosting) + project state to surface what *actually* needs attention vs what's noise. Before this skill, that ritual was a 4-tab manual scan that took 15 minutes and missed half the signal — and worse, didn't connect it to the active projects' plans.

`/briefing` is the answer to "Morning <user.name>, here's the lay of the land — and here's what to ship today." Its **mandatory floor** runs with zero external tools: read the active-projects index, tail each project's `memory.md`, read USER.md priority signals, read contacts. Its **optional composition layer** uses whatever's configured — `gws gmail +triage` / `gws calendar +agenda` via Bash (if `gws` CLI is installed), `mcp__slack__*` (if Slack MCP is authorized), `mcp__atlassian__*` (if Atlassian MCP is authorized), `gh pr list` (if `gh` CLI is installed), `/find` (always present, optional last step). Step 0.5 detects what's available at runtime; Step 0.6 probes auth health on each detected tool and pauses via AskUserQuestion if any are errored (so dead tokens are caught before the brief is composed, not after); later steps gate on the post-probe map.

The novel piece is the **project synthesis layer**: reading each active project's `memory.md` tail and `CLAUDE.md` status to recommend today's highest-leverage work. That layer is mandatory-floor — works whether <user.name> has a fully-configured multi-MCP stack or no MCPs at all.

This is the broad probe-then-compose briefing surface. The same sources may be narrowed into focused meeting-prep, standup, or weekly-recap modes without depending on separate wrapper skills.

## When to use

Trigger phrases (broad — day-orientation is the pattern, not the literal command):

- `/briefing` / `/briefing for today`
- "morning briefing" / "daily brief" / "give me the rundown"
- "what's on my plate today?" / "what needs me today?"
- "orient me for the day" / "what should I tackle first?"
- "what should I work on today" — directly hits the project-synthesis layer
- "brief me" (when context is start-of-day)
- "morning <assistant.name>" / "good morning" — reactive opener to a new session

Do NOT trigger for:
- A focused meeting-prep request — use this skill's calendar/contact/transcript probes for that meeting only and save under the configured meeting-prep resource folder.
- A weekly recap — use the requested date window and summarize the same evidence sources; do not invent a missing wrapper.
- A standup-only request — focus on active project memory, yesterday's journal, current blockers, and today's plan.
- A literal question like "what is a briefing?" or "draft a briefing template" — that's content, not invocation.
- Sending the brief somewhere — briefing writes a local file, never auto-sends. If <user.name> wants to share it, they say so explicitly.

## Source of truth

- **Output convention** — `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html` per README §Outputs. Briefings live next to `meetings/` (raw transcripts) in Resources, since briefings are reference material the user re-reads. Path moved here from a top-level `docs/` folder in v0.1.5 — Resources is the right PARA home for synthesis-layer outputs.
- **Priority signals** — read at runtime from USER.md "Priority Signals" section. Per fork, <user.name>'s collaborators / urgency rules differ.
- **Contacts directory** — `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/<slug>.md`. Schema documented at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/README.md`.
- **Active projects** — `bash <scripts.project_query>` returns live tabular view (status, project-type, days-since-touched, stale flag). Each project has its own `CLAUDE.md` (status frontmatter) and `memory.md` (append-only decision log).
- **Tool inventory** — `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/reference/tool-inventory.md` §10 has the canonical Layer 3 design implications + composition map.

## Tiger-grade invariants (LOAD-BEARING — DO NOT VIOLATE)

These **six** invariants protect against high-cost failure modes. They are stated multiple times throughout this skill (in description, here, in step headers, in `references/failure-modes.md`) by design — premortem-tier risks need redundancy.

### T1 — Output path is fixed

Briefing output **always** lands at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.html`. The date is today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Never at workspace root. Never inside a project folder. Never in `<workspace.inbox>/`. Never `morning-briefing.html` (no date suffix). Never `.md` (HTML-only output as of v0.2.0; markdown source path retired — see Step 9).

If the file already exists for today (re-running the briefing same-day), append a timestamp: `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.html`. Do not overwrite the original — <user.name> may have read or edited it.

### T2 — Filter `status: personal` contacts BEFORE building "Open commitments by person"

The contacts directory holds both work AND personal contacts (status enum: `active | inactive | external | personal`). Briefing is a **work-context skill**. Personal contacts (friends, family, side-project collaborators) are intentionally segregated and must never bleed into a work brief.

Implementation: when iterating `<workspace.resources>/contacts/<slug>.md` files, parse frontmatter and skip any where `status: personal`. Do this at read time, not display time — stripping at display means the data was still loaded into context and could leak via summarization.

### T3 — Never fabricate signals

When an MCP returns empty (no Jira tickets, no Slack messages, no calendar events), the corresponding section either:
- **Omits entirely** — clean output, no awkward empty headers
- OR writes a single line like "No active Jira tickets" / "No unread Slack mentions" / "Calendar is clear today"

Never invent fake tickets, fake messages, fake meetings, fake commitments, or fake project recommendations. The "Today's work from your projects" section is especially exposed here — if a project has a thin or empty `memory.md`, surface that fact ("project X has no recent memory entries") rather than invent next-actions. If a tool errors at runtime (was detected as present but failed mid-call), surface the error in the section's place: "⚠️ Slack MCP errored — skipping Slack digest." Briefing accuracy is the entire value proposition; fabricated content makes it actively harmful.

### T4 — Graceful degradation when tools are absent

The briefing has a **mandatory floor** that runs with zero external tools: project synthesis (Step 7), open commitments (Step 5), today's date, USER.md priority signals. Everything else is **optional composition** gated on tool detection in Step 0.5.

For each gated step (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Jira, GitHub):
- **If the underlying tool is NOT in the detection map** (`gws` not installed, `mcp__slack__*` not in deferred-tools list, etc.): omit the section entirely from the brief body. NEVER write a "⚠️ X not configured" line into the body — that's noise for users who never wanted that tool. Footer (Step 9) documents the omission transparently.
- **If the tool IS detected but errors at runtime** (auth expired, network failure, MCP returned an error): write a single ⚠️ line in the section's place ("⚠️ Slack MCP errored — skipping Slack digest") AND log to the footer.
- **Never fabricate a tool call.** If `gws` is absent, do NOT invent fake Gmail entries to fill the section. If Slack MCP isn't loaded, do NOT make up Slack messages to flesh out the brief. T3 governs this; T4 codifies that absent tools are FIRST-CLASS state, not an error to paper over.

The `## Tools used` footer at the bottom of every brief lists which signal sources were composed vs which were not configured vs which errored. This is the single source of truth for "what's in this brief" — never invent a section header that the footer doesn't back.

Fork users with zero MCPs still get a useful brief from the mandatory floor: project memory tails, today-relevant signals, priority-ranked synthesis. That's not a degraded experience; that's the floor of the value proposition.

### T5 — Slack sweep MUST cover all four channel types

Slack has FOUR distinct surfaces: `public_channel`, `private_channel`, `im` (1:1 DM), and `mpim` (group DM, 3+ people). The skill's Step 3 sweep MUST cover all four every run. Narrowing `channel_types` to a subset has historically hidden high-signal multi-person threads.

**Origin incident:** a multi-person DM (MPIM) thread containing the highest-leverage open question of the week was invisible to the original briefing because every Slack query narrowed `channel_types` to either `im` alone or `public_channel,private_channel` — so MPIMs were excluded by construction. The recovery query took thirty seconds; the miss in the original brief cost an hour of "what else might I be missing" thrash.

**Implementation rule:** for every Slack search query in Step 3, EITHER omit `channel_types` entirely (default = all four), OR set `channel_types: "public_channel,private_channel,mpim,im"`. NEVER narrow to a subset without an explicit reason. The default-omit form is preferred because there are fewer ways to silently break it. See Step 3 #T5 for the full four-pass spec.

**Pre-Write assertion (Step 9):** the assembled brief must include at least one Slack search whose `channel_types` was either omitted or contained `mpim`. If you cannot point to one, the sweep was incomplete — re-run Step 3 before composing.

### T6 — Briefing HTML must render correctly in Gmail

The briefing's primary surface is <user.name>'s inbox. They generate the file with `/briefing`, then paste the HTML into Gmail to read on their phone or desktop client. Gmail's renderer strips `display: grid`, `position: sticky`, `position: fixed`, and viewport units (`vh`, `vw`) — any of which break the layout while leaving background colors orphaned as giant empty blocks above the actual content.

**Origin incident:** the 2026-05-19 morning brief used the design-dashboard sidebar layout (`body { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 240px 1fr; min-height: 100vh; }` + `.sidebar { position: sticky; height: 100vh; }`). Gmail stripped the grid + sticky, the sidebar's beige background became a full-width ~1000px void at the top, and the first KPI didn't appear until well below the fold. <user.name> had to scroll past empty space to find the briefing.

**Implementation rule (enforced by Step 9 Pre-Write assertion):**
- NO `display: grid` on any layout container. Use `flex` with `flex-wrap` for KPI rows.
- NO `position: sticky` or `position: fixed`. Period.
- NO viewport units anywhere — use `px` or `%`.
- NO `<aside>` sidebar. Navigation lives in a horizontal `.topnav` inside `<main>`.
- `<main>` is a centered max-width container (`max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto`).

**Pre-Write assertion (Step 9):** grep the final HTML for `grid-template`, `position: sticky`, `position: fixed`, `100vh`, `100vw`, `<aside` — ZERO matches required. If any match, rewrite before Write.

## Process

### Step 0: Load context (parallel reads, cheap)

Run these in parallel via separate tool calls (no dependencies between them):

1. **Today's date** — Bash: `date +%Y-%m-%d` and `date +%H:%M` for the header.
2. **USER.md priority signals** — Read root `USER.md`, locate "Priority Signals" section. Extract:
   - Direct collaborators list (high-priority senders)
   - URGENT triggers (calendar conflicts, team blockers)
   - HIGH topics (e.g., AI/technical for <user.name>)
   - LOW filters (newsletters, generic updates)
3. **Active projects** — Bash: `bash <scripts.project_query>` (no flags = active only). Cache the rows (slug, status, project-type, days-since-touched) for Step 7's project synthesis.
4. **Contacts list** — Bash: `ls <workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/*.md` to get the file list (NOT the contents — those come in Step 5).
5. **Briefing output path** — compute target file path: `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-${DATE}.html`. If it already exists, set the path to `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-${DATE}-${TIME}.html` per T1.
6. **Active design tokens** — Bash: `cat DESIGN.md` (cwd-relative — resolves to the active DESIGN.md whether root-level or project-overridden). Cache the file content for Step 9 — colors, typography, spacing all come from there. Required for HTML composition. If `DESIGN.md` does not exist at cwd, fall back to the canonical defaults in `references/html-composition.md` and surface a one-line `⚠️` in the footer ("DESIGN.md not found — used neutral defaults"); never invent tokens.

### Step 0.5: Detect available tools (probe-then-compose — T4 invariant)

Build a `detection` map that gates Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. **This step is what enables fork users with any tool stack (or none) to get a useful brief.** Pattern modeled after `/bootstrap` Phase 1's MCP probe (added in v0.1.4).

Run these probes in parallel:

```bash
command -v gws 2>&1            # detection.cli.gws — gates Steps 1 (Gmail) + 2 (Calendar)
command -v gh 2>&1             # detection.cli.gh — gates Step 6 (GitHub recent shipped)
```

For each MCP, check the **deferred-tools list at the top of the session** (the system reminder that lists `mcp__<name>__*` tools available for this workspace):

- `detection.mcp.slack = true` if ≥1 `mcp__slack__*` tool appears (gates Step 3 — Slack digest)
- `detection.mcp.atlassian = true` if ≥1 `mcp__atlassian__*` tool appears (gates Step 4 — Jira queue)

**Honesty rules** (T4):
- If `command -v gws` exits 0 → `detection.cli.gws = true`; CLI is callable, but the user's `gws auth status` may still be unauth'd. That's a runtime-error case handled in Step 1, not a not-configured case.
- If a `mcp__<name>__*` tool is in the deferred-tools list → the MCP server is loaded and authorized for THIS workspace cwd (Claude Code isolates OAuth state per-project — see bootstrap Phase 1 §honesty rule).
- If a tool is absent from the detection map → the section it backs is omitted silently from the brief body (no `⚠️ X not configured` line). The `## Tools used` footer in Step 9 documents the omission.
- Never gate on a tool's CONTENT (e.g., "did Gmail return ≥1 unread") — that's a runtime concern. Step 0.5 only checks availability.

**Output**: a cached `detection` map used by every subsequent step. Example shapes:

```
# A fully-configured fork:
detection = {cli: {gws: true, gh: true}, mcp: {slack: true, atlassian: true}}
# A partial fork (no MCPs auth'd, but gh is installed):
detection = {cli: {gws: false, gh: true}, mcp: {slack: false, atlassian: false}}
# Zero-tool fork (mandatory floor only):
detection = {cli: {gws: false, gh: false}, mcp: {slack: false, atlassian: false}}
```

The zero-tool case still produces a useful brief — Steps 5 (commitments), 7 (project synthesis), 8 (find cross-refs) all run from local files. That's the floor.

### Step 0.6: Verify connectivity (auth-health probe — T4 fail-fast)

Detection in Step 0.5 only checks **availability** (is the binary on PATH; is the MCP loaded). It does NOT check **auth health**. A Slack MCP can be loaded but have an expired OAuth token. A `gws` CLI can be installed but unauth'd. These are silent failures if you only learn about them when a Step 1-4 call returns an error mid-compose — by then the brief is half-written and <user.name>'s only path is to re-run.

**Step 0.6 catches auth death BEFORE composition starts.** For every tool that detected as `true` in Step 0.5, run a cheap probe. If any probe fails, surface ALL failures via `AskUserQuestion` and let <user.name> decide before writing a single section.

**Probes (parallel, all fast):**

| Tool | Probe | Pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| `gws` (cli) | `gws auth status --format json` | exit 0, `auth_method` field present |
| `gh` (cli) | `gh auth status` | exit 0 |
| Slack MCP | `mcp__slack__slack_search_channels` with `limit=1` | no error response |
| Atlassian MCP | `mcp__atlassian__atlassianUserInfo` | no error response |

Build a `connectivity` map: `{gws: ok|errored|<cause>, slack: ok|errored|<cause>, ...}` keyed off Step 0.5's detected tools.

**Decision gate:**

- **All probes ok** → `connectivity` map all green; continue to Step 1 without prompting. (Most common path; ~3s overhead total.)
- **Any probe errored** → surface via `AskUserQuestion`:

  ```
  Question: "Auth issues detected before I compose the brief. What do you want to do?"
  Options (single-select):
    1. "Cancel — let me re-auth, then re-run /briefing"  (recommended; first option)
    2. "Skip the errored tools and continue"
    3. "Continue anyway (treat as runtime errors in the brief)"
  Question header (chip): "Auth gate"
  ```

  The question body MUST enumerate every failed tool + its cause + the fix command. Example:

  ```
  ⚠️ Slack MCP — OAuth token expired (run /mcp to refresh)
  ⚠️ Atlassian MCP — authorization required (run /mcp to authorize)

  Slack is high-value for your morning brief; skipping it leaves a hole. Up to you.
  ```

  Customize the "Slack is high-value" framing per tool — Slack and Gmail are typically high-value for chief-of-staff briefs; gh is lower-stakes. Pull the framing from USER.md "Priority signals" if available.

**Handle the response:**

- **"Cancel — let me re-auth"** → exit cleanly. Print:

  ```
  No brief written. Re-auth and re-run when ready:
    • Slack MCP — run /mcp, then /briefing
    • Atlassian MCP — run /mcp, then /briefing
    • gws — run `gws auth login` (or check `gws auth status` for details)
    • gh — run `gh auth login`
  ```

  List ONLY the tools that errored. Do NOT write a partial brief.

- **"Skip the errored tools and continue"** → for each errored tool, flip its `detection.<tool>` flag to `false`. The Steps 1-6 gates will treat it as not-configured — silent omit from body. Footer (Step 9) routes it to a new `⏭️ Skipped (auth error, you chose to continue)` bucket — distinct from `⏳ Not configured` (genuinely absent) and `⚠️ Errored at runtime` (passed Step 0.6 but failed mid-call). Continue to Step 1.

- **"Continue anyway"** → leave `detection` flags as-is. Steps 1-6 will hit the runtime errors themselves and write `⚠️ <Tool> errored — <cause>` lines per the existing T4 path. Use this option only when <user.name> wants the brief to surface the error inline for some reason (rare). Continue to Step 1.

**Failure modes Step 0.6 prevents:**

- "Brief written, then I find out Slack was dead" → Step 0.6 catches it first.
- "I had to run /briefing twice today" → Cancel-and-re-auth path is one round-trip, not two.
- "The brief has misleading empty Slack section because the call errored" → Skip path demotes to silent-omit, footer documents.

**Failure modes Step 0.6 does NOT prevent:**

- A tool that's healthy at 0.6 but errors at composition time (e.g., calendar fetches but rate-limits on a follow-up call). The existing T4 runtime-error path still handles this with inline `⚠️` lines.
- A tool that returns empty results legitimately (no unreads, no events). That's not an error; T3 governs the empty case.

**Cost discipline:** every probe must be free or near-free (< 500ms typical). If a probe is slow, it's the wrong probe — find a cheaper one. The whole Step 0.6 budget is ~2-3 seconds against the gain of avoiding compose-discover-recompose loops.

### Step 1: Gmail triage — "What needs you today" inputs

**Gate (T4):** runs ONLY if `detection.cli.gws == true`. If false, skip this step entirely — no section header, no `⚠️` line in the body. The `## Tools used` footer (Step 9) will list Gmail as "not configured."

**Run `gws gmail +triage --max 20 --format json` via Bash** (the wrapper skill that previously normalized this was retired in the 2026-05-17 trim — call the CLI directly). Returns unread inbox summary with sender, subject, date. Pipe through `jq` if you need to reshape; the default JSON output is one object per message with `from`, `subject`, `date`, `snippet` fields.

Apply USER.md priority signals to classify each unread:
- **URGENT** — sender is in direct-collaborators list AND subject contains an urgency keyword (deadline, blocker, ASAP, urgent), OR sender is the user's manager
- **HIGH** — sender in direct-collaborators OR topic matches HIGH list (e.g., AI/technical)
- **STANDARD** — everything else
- **LOW (filter out from brief)** — newsletters, generic updates per LOW filter

Output: a list of (URGENT + HIGH) entries only — no more than ~7. STANDARD goes into a count ("plus 12 standard unreads"). LOW is excluded entirely.

If `gws gmail +triage` errors at runtime (e.g., `gws` is installed but auth expired): write "⚠️ Gmail errored — <one-line cause>" in the section and note in the footer. If it returns empty (no unreads): write "No urgent unreads." Distinguish: not-detected = silent omit (Step 0.5 gate); detected-but-errored = ⚠️ line; detected-and-empty = "No urgent unreads."

### Step 2: Calendar agenda — "Calendar at a glance" + conflict detection

**Gate (T4):** runs ONLY if `detection.cli.gws == true`. If false, skip this step entirely — no section in body. Footer documents "not configured."

**Run `gws calendar +agenda --today --format json` via Bash** (the wrapper skill was retired in the 2026-05-17 trim — call the CLI directly). Returns today's events across all calendars. Each event object has `summary`, `start`, `end`, `attendees`, `description` fields.

Process:
- Sort by start time
- Detect conflicts (overlapping events) — flag with 🔴 emoji per USER.md formatting prefs (status indicators OK in briefings)
- Note any events with no description / no attendees as a tag (might need prep)
- Pull next 3 events specifically for the "What needs you today" section

If `gws calendar +agenda` errors at runtime: write "⚠️ Calendar errored — <one-line cause>" + log to footer. Do not invent events. If it returns empty: "Calendar is clear today."

### Step 3: Slack digest — FOUR-SURFACE SWEEP

**Gate (T4):** runs ONLY if `detection.mcp.slack == true` (≥1 `mcp__slack__*` tool in the deferred-tools list). If false, skip entirely — no section in body. Footer documents "not configured." Per T4, do NOT write "⚠️ Slack not configured" inline; that's noise for users who never configured Slack.

#### T5 — MANDATORY four-surface coverage (load-bearing invariant)

Slack has **FOUR** distinct surfaces. The skill MUST cover all four every run. Missing any one creates the exact failure mode that hid the Bob/Jay group DM from the 2026-05-17 brief — a multi-person high-signal thread sat invisible because the queries excluded `mpim`. Never repeat this.

| Surface | `channel_type` | What lives here | Coverage rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public channel | `public_channel` | Team channels, mentions, broadcasts | MUST search |
| Private channel | `private_channel` | Project/exec channels `<user.name>` is in | MUST search |
| 1:1 DM | `im` | Direct messages with one other person | MUST search |
| **Group DM (3+ people)** | **`mpim`** | **Multi-party threads — execs collaborating, working groups, ad-hoc squads** | **MUST search (this is the historically-missed one)** |

**Implementation rule:** for every Slack search query in Step 3, EITHER omit `channel_types` entirely (default includes all four), OR set `channel_types: "public_channel,private_channel,mpim,im"` explicitly. NEVER narrow to a subset unless you're running a deliberate scoped follow-up. The default-omit form is preferred — fewer ways to silently break.

**Pre-Write assertion:** in Step 9 the brief must include at least one Slack search whose `channel_types` was either omitted or contained `mpim`. If you cannot point to one, the sweep was incomplete — re-run Step 3 before composing.

#### The four passes — run in this order

1. **Pass A — Owed replies across ALL surfaces** (the chief-of-staff move; ranked highest):
   - Query: `to:<@<USER_SLACK_ID>> after:<7d-cutoff>`
   - `channel_types`: **omit** (defaults to all four) — explicitly DO NOT narrow to `im` only
   - This catches messages addressed to the user in 1:1 DMs, group DMs, AND channel mentions where last message is from someone else
   - For each result, the heuristic is: "someone wrote to `<user.name>`; has `<user.name>` replied since?" If not → it's owed.

2. **Pass B — @-mentions in channels** (broader awareness):
   - Query: `<@<USER_SLACK_ID>> after:<7d-cutoff>`
   - `channel_types: "public_channel,private_channel"` (named channels only — Pass A already covered DM/MPIM mentions)
   - Catches "[name] flagged you in #channel" patterns even if not directly addressed

3. **Pass C — the user's own thread participation needing follow-up**:
   - Query: `from:<@<USER_SLACK_ID>> is:thread after:<7d-cutoff>`
   - `channel_types`: omit (all four)
   - For each thread the user posted in, check via `slack_read_thread` if anyone replied AFTER their last message → owed follow-up

4. **Pass D — Priority channel activity digest**:
   - If `USER.md` has a `## Priority Slack Channels` section, iterate that list via `slack_read_channel` (top ~5 messages each, last 24h)
   - Otherwise, enumerate user's channel membership via `slack_search_channels` and pick channels with high recent activity (>10 messages/24h)
   - Surface top message by reaction count + any thread the user participated in

**Cross-check after passes A-D:** before composing the brief, run a sanity grep on the assembled "owed replies" list — count distinct people, count distinct channel types. If the list has 0 MPIM entries AND USER.md indicates the user is in any group DMs (or `slack_search_channels` returned any MPIM in the channel list), spend ONE more query: `from:<@<USER_SLACK_ID>>` with `channel_types: mpim` to verify MPIMs are genuinely quiet, not just missed. Document the check in the footer if MPIM count is 0.

**Timestamp quirk to know about:** `slack_search_public_and_private` sometimes returns far-future literal dates ("year 56347xxx") due to a Slack search index quirk. The *message content* is real and current. Frame surfaced messages by relative recency ("today", "yesterday", "earlier this morning") rather than echoing the literal date column. Don't show the noisy date strings to <user.name>.

#### Output structure (preserved order)

- **Owed replies — Tier 1 (multi-person blockers, time-sensitive, manager chain)** — top 3-5
- **Owed replies — Tier 2 (real questions, you owe substantive answer)** — top 3-5
- **Owed replies — Tier 3 (warm acknowledgments, low urgency)** — top 3
- **@-mentions in channels (no direct ask)** — top 5
- **Active channels — Priority-pinned first, then dynamic** — top 3
- **Threads where the user posted but someone replied after** — top 3

Every surfaced item must include: who, where (channel name + type — flag MPIMs as "group DM"), when (relative), one-line text, and a Tier classification.

If a USER.md "Priority Slack Channels" section exists, prepend those channels to the active-channels list. Otherwise rely on dynamic enumeration. Surface a hint at section bottom: *"💡 To pin specific channels to the top of this digest, add a `## Priority Slack Channels` section to USER.md."*

If Slack MCP errors at runtime (was detected but call failed): write "⚠️ Slack MCP errored — <one-line cause>" + log to footer. Do not invent messages.

### Step 4: Jira queue

**Gate (T4):** runs ONLY if `detection.mcp.atlassian == true` (≥1 `mcp__atlassian__*` tool in the deferred-tools list). If false, skip entirely — no section in body. Footer documents "not configured."

Compose `mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with query: `assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done ORDER BY duedate ASC, priority DESC`.

Process:
- Group by status (In Progress / To Do / Blocked)
- Flag past-due (duedate < today) with 🔴
- Surface top ~7

If Atlassian MCP errors at runtime: write "⚠️ Jira MCP errored — <one-line cause>" + log to footer. If it returns empty: "No active Jira tickets."

### Step 5: Open commitments by person — T2 INVARIANT (filter `status: personal`)

**T2 reminder: filter `status: personal` BEFORE reading body content.** This is a work-context skill — personal contacts never appear here.

Process:
1. For each contact file at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/contacts/<slug>.md`:
   - Read frontmatter only first (Bash: `head -30 <file>`)
   - Parse `status:` field
   - **If `status: personal`, SKIP this file entirely.** Do not read body. Do not include slug in any subsequent step.
2. For each remaining contact (status `active`, `inactive`, or `external`):
   - Read full file
   - Parse `## Open commitments` section
   - Extract "From <name>" subsection (things the contact has promised the user)
   - Extract "To <name>" subsection (things the user has promised the contact) — flag any that are stale (>14 days since logged)
3. Compose section:
   - Group by contact name
   - Use WikiLink format: `[[contacts/<slug>]]`
   - Surface only contacts with at least one open commitment

If a contact file has no `## Open commitments` section, skip silently — not all contacts have one yet.

If contacts directory is empty: per T3, write "No contacts logged yet — add files under contacts/ to start tracking commitments by person."

### Step 6: GitHub recent shipped

**Gate (T4):** runs ONLY if `detection.cli.gh == true`. If false, skip entirely — no section in body. Footer documents "not configured."

Bash: `gh pr list --author=@me --state=merged --search "merged:>$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d)" --limit 10 --json number,title,url,mergedAt,headRepository`

(Note: `--json repository` is invalid — the correct field name is `headRepository`. Easy to fumble.)

Process:
- Parse JSON
- Sort by mergedAt desc
- Format as bullet list: `- <title> (<repo>) — <url>`

If `gh` errors at runtime (was detected but call failed — auth expired, network): write "⚠️ GitHub auth issue — <one-line cause>" + log to footer. If it returns empty: "No PRs merged in the last 7 days."

### Step 7: Project synthesis — "Today's work from your projects"

This is the load-bearing chief-of-staff section. Don't list projects flatly — read each one and recommend.

For each active project from Step 0's `project-query.sh` output:

1. **Read the project's `CLAUDE.md`** — extract status frontmatter (status, project-type, last-updated). Skip projects with `status: paused` or `status: done` (shouldn't appear, but safety check).
2. **Read the tail of `memory.md`** — Bash: `tail -80 <project>/memory.md` to get the most recent ~3 entries. Parse for:
   - Most recent date entry
   - "Decision:" / "Decided:" patterns → what just got resolved
   - "Next:" / "Open:" / "Pending:" patterns → what's queued
   - "Blocked:" / "Waiting on:" patterns → what's stuck
   - Any "shipped" / "✅" markers from the last 7 days → momentum signals
3. **Cross-reference today's calendar** (from Step 2) — if any of today's calendar events have a topic matching this project's slug or recent memory keywords, flag the project as "today-relevant" (you'll be discussing it).
4. **Cross-reference open commitments** (from Step 5) — if open commitments mention this project, the project owes someone something.

Then **synthesize per project** (don't dump raw memory):

```
### <Project name> 🟢/🟡/🔴
**Status:** <one-line from CLAUDE.md frontmatter or memory.md latest "Status:" line>
**Latest move:** <most recent memory entry summary, ~1 line>
**Today's recommended action:** <opinionated — what should ship next based on Next:/Blocked: signals>
**Today-relevant:** <yes/no — calendar event matches, OR commitment due, OR stale >7 days>
```

Status emoji rules:
- 🟢 — active momentum (memory entry within last 3 days, no blockers)
- 🟡 — slow (no memory entry in 4-14 days, OR has a Blocked: marker)
- 🔴 — stale or critical (no memory in 14+ days, OR Blocked: + today-relevant)

Order projects: 🔴 first (urgency), then 🟡 today-relevant, then 🟢 today-relevant, then 🟡 not today-relevant, then 🟢 not today-relevant.

**Cap:** surface top 5 projects. If there are more, end with "+ N more active projects — see `bash <scripts.project_query>` for the full list."

**Final synthesis line** at the end of this section:

> **From what I'm seeing, the highest-leverage work today is: <pick one, justify in one clause>.**

This is the opinionated chief-of-staff voice. Pick based on: (a) intersection of today-relevant + 🔴/🟡 status, (b) open commitments due, (c) calendar weight (lots of meetings → less heads-down time → recommend a focused micro-task; light calendar → recommend a deep project block).

Per T3: if a project has a thin `memory.md` (fewer than 2 entries), surface that — "Project X has no recent memory entries" — instead of inventing recommendations.

If `project-query.sh` returns empty: write "No active projects — your `1-Projects/` folder is clean. Anything new to scaffold? Use `/new-project`."

### Step 8: Optional cross-references via `/find`

For the top 3-5 calendar events from Step 2 with substantive topics (NOT recurring 1:1s, standups, or weekly reviews):
- For each event topic, invoke `/find <topic>` to surface "you have a relevant note on this"
- This produces the optional "Notes & cross-references" section at the bottom of the brief

This step is **optional** — if `/find` is unavailable or returns nothing for all events, omit the section entirely. Don't error.

### Step 9: Compose and write the brief as a self-contained HTML dashboard

Output is a **single self-contained HTML file** styled with the active DESIGN.md tokens (cached in Step 0), **email-safe** so it survives being pasted into Gmail. **Load `references/html-composition.md` before composing** — it carries the full DOM scaffold, the canonical color fallbacks, the hard rules, the voice guide, the section-omission rules, and the complete pre-Write assertion checklist. The fixed DOM contract (section order + `data-od-id` slugs) is in `references/output-format.md`.

The load-bearing summary (full detail in those references):
- **Self-contained:** one file, all CSS inline, NO `<script>` / external links / `<img src=http>`. Inline SVG only.
- **Email-safe (T6):** NO `display:grid` on layout containers, NO `position:sticky/fixed`, NO viewport units, NO `<aside>` sidebar. Centered max-width `<main>` + horizontal `.topnav`; KPI row is `flex-wrap`.
- **Tokens:** seed `:root` from DESIGN.md; if absent, use the canonical fallbacks in the reference (`--bg:#f5f4ed; --fg:#141413; --muted:#5e5d59; --border:#e8e6dc; --accent:#c96442; --surface:#faf9f5; --good:#3f6f4f; --warn:#b07a2c; --bad:#b53333;`). Never invent hex; never re-derive the semantic trio.
- **Structure:** semantic HTML; every region carries `data-od-id="<slug>"`; fixed section order; gated sections omit cleanly (drop the `<section>` AND its nav anchor); mandatory-floor sections (what-needs-you, projects, commitments, tools-used) always present.
- **Voice (SOUL.md):** opinionated chief-of-staff ("ship X because Y"), warm + direct tagline that leads with the highest-leverage move; NO em-dashes in body copy.

**Pre-Write assertions (run ALL — full list in the reference):** path ends `.html` (T1); `<!doctype html>`…`</html>` present; `data-od-id="tools-used"` present (T4); no `<script>`/`http`; no `status: personal` slug (T2); grep `grid-template`/`position: sticky`/`position: fixed`/`100vh`/`100vw`/`<aside` → zero (T6); ≥1 Slack search with `channel_types` omitted or `mpim` (T5); em-dash count ≤2.

**T1: write to `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-${DATE}.html`** (or `-${DATE}-${TIME}.html` if same-day collision). Confirm the path before Write; `mkdir -p` the briefings dir if missing.

### Step 10: Surface to user

Don't dump the full brief into chat — that's the file's job. Instead:

```
Morning <user.name>! Brief is ready at `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/morning-briefing-<DATE>.html` — open in a browser.

Top 3 from "What needs you today":
1. <item>
2. <item>
3. <item>

Highest-leverage work today: <one-line synthesis from Step 7's closing line>.

<Optional line — INCLUDE ONLY IF Step 0.5's detection map had any `false` entries:>
ℹ️ Composed from <N>/5 optional signal sources. <skipped tools list>. See `## Tools used` footer in the brief for setup hints.

That's the lay of the land. Where do you want to start?
```

This gives <user.name> the headline + the project synthesis + a prompt for direction without forcing him to scroll. For full-stack users with everything detected, omit the `ℹ️` line entirely — it's only there when degradation occurred, to flag "you could get more by configuring X."

## Failure modes

See **`references/failure-modes.md`** — symptom → cause → fix for every known failure (wrong path, `.md` output, Gmail empty-block, personal-contact leak, fabricated signals, gate bypass, missed MPIM, flat project section, etc.), each keyed to the T-invariant it enforces.

## Boundaries

- **Never auto-send.** Briefing is a draft that <user.name> reads. Sending to Slack/email/Jira requires explicit "send it" from <user.name> (per CLAUDE.md "Boundaries"). Drafts only.
- **Never modify project files.** This skill READS `<workspace.projects>/*/CLAUDE.md` and `<workspace.projects>/*/memory.md` (via project-query.sh and tail) and `<workspace.resources>/contacts/*.md`. It does NOT write to either.
- **Never auto-commit.** The briefing file is uncommitted by default; <user.name> commits it (or not — `<workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/briefings/` may be `<user.name>`-curated).
- **Never call Exa directly** (token-isolation rule). If a topic needs external research, suggest `/find` for workspace content or `/entity-research` for a company/person.
- **Never fabricate.** T3 invariant. Empty MCP → empty section or short note. Thin project memory → surface that fact, don't invent recommendations.
- **Never mix personal-life content into work brief.** T2 invariant. `status: personal` contacts filtered at read time.
- **Never assume a tool is present.** T4 invariant. Step 0.5 detects availability; Steps 1-6 gate on it. Absent tools omit silently from body, footer documents. Never invent a tool call to fill a section; never write a "⚠️ X not configured" line into the body.

## Output format reference

The brief's stable DOM contract — fixed section order, `data-od-id` slugs, per-section gating behavior, and the "why HTML not Markdown" rationale — lives in **`references/output-format.md`**. Any downstream parser should use those slugs rather than presentation text.
