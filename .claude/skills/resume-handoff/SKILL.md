name: resume-handoff
description: >-
  Resume work from a previous session's handoff document. Use when the user says 'continue from last session', 'pick up where we left off', 'load the handoff', 'resume from handoff', 'what was I working on', or '/resume-handoff'. Reads the handoff YAML, verifies current codebase state, presents a synthesis with recommended next actions, then optionally resumes an /autonomous session. Pass a path or ticket number, or omit for workspace-wide discovery.

## Step 0 — Resolve storage roots

Two roots, both walked-up from CWD:

**state_root** (for `continuum/autonomous/`, `continuum/research/`, `thoughts/shared/plans/`, `thoughts/shared/research/` — project work artifacts):
1. If CWD is inside `<workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/<slug>/` → `state_root = <workspace.root>/<workspace.projects>/<slug>/`
2. If CWD is inside `<workspace.root>/<workspace.coding>/<name>/` → `state_root = <workspace.root>/<workspace.coding>/<name>/`
3. If CWD has a `CLAUDE.md` or `.git/` but no parent workspace match → `state_root = <repo_root>` (standalone repo / original CCv4 mode)
4. None of the above → `AskUserQuestion`: "No project context detected. Which project should this run in?" Never silently fall back.

**handoff_root** (for `handoffs/`, `library/` — session metadata):
- If `<workspace.resources>` is defined in CLAUDE.md Configuration AND `<workspace.root>/` exists as a directory on disk → `handoff_root = <workspace.root>/<workspace.resources>/` (multi-project / workspace mode — handoffs pool workspace-wide)
- Else → `handoff_root = <state_root>/thoughts/shared/` (single-project mode — original CCv4 behavior, no workspace)
- If `<handoff_root>/` subfolder doesn't exist yet → create on first write (`mkdir -p` semantic).

Use `<state_root>/continuum/...` and `<handoff_root>/handoffs/{session-name}/...` in place of any relative paths in the rest of this skill.

Resume work from handoff through interactive analysis. Handoffs contain critical context, learnings, next steps from previous sessions requiring full understanding before continuation.

**Parameter Handling:** If handoff path provided, immediately read document and linked research/plans under `<handoff_root>/plans` or `<handoff_root>/research` — no sub-agents for critical files. If ticket number (ENG-XXXX) provided, list `<handoff_root>/handoffs/ENG-XXXX/` contents. Zero files or missing directory: "Can't find handoff, please provide path." One file: proceed. Multiple files: use most recent by YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM timestamp. No parameters (single-project mode): respond with "I'll help resume from handoff. Which would you like? Tip: /resume-handoff path or /resume-handoff ENG-XXXX"

**No-args workspace-wide discovery:** If no arguments and CWD resolves to multi-project mode (per Step 0), scan `<handoff_root>/handoffs/*/` for the most recent handoff (mtime-sorted), present its session-name + date + summary, then `AskUserQuestion`: "Resume this, or pick a different one?" If user picks "different", list all session folders mtime-sorted with last-handoff date and let user pick. Single-project mode falls through to the prompt above.

**Next Session Prompt Priority:** After reading handoff, check for `next_session_prompt:` field. If exists, present directly: "Previous session left prompt: > {contents} Shall I proceed or adjust approach?" If user approves, execute as-is using rest of handoff for context. Skip analysis steps — they're for handoffs lacking direct prompts.

**Full Analysis (when no next_session_prompt):** Read handoff completely without limit/offset. Spawn focused research tasks verifying current state — gather artifact context from feature docs, implementation plans, research documents mentioned. Wait for ALL sub-tasks before proceeding. Read critical files from learnings and recent changes sections.

**Present Synthesis:** "Analyzed handoff from [date]. Current situation: Original Tasks: [task]: [handoff status] → [current verification]. Key Learnings Validated: [learning with file:line] - [still valid/changed]. Recent Changes Status: [change] - [verified/missing/modified]. Artifacts Reviewed: [doc]: [takeaway]. Recommended Next Actions: [logical steps from handoff]. Potential Issues: [conflicts/regressions]. Shall I proceed with [action] or adjust?"

> **Bridge to project_root:** After reading the handoff YAML, extract the `project_root:` field from frontmatter. If present, treat that path (relative to `repo_root`) as the project context for the rest of resume — look for `continuum/autonomous/` and other state at `<repo_root>/<project_root>/continuum/...`, not at CWD. If absent, fall back to CWD (single-project / pre-split legacy handoffs).

**Resume Autonomous Session:** After presenting synthesis and getting confirmation, check for an existing `/autonomous` session in `<state_root>/continuum/autonomous/`. If one exists with pending milestones, resume it — the handoff provides updated context and mental model, `/autonomous` drives execution. If no autonomous session exists, offer to start one using the handoff's `next:` steps and `next_session_prompt:` as the task specification.

**Validation Approach:** Be thorough — read entire handoff, verify ALL mentioned changes exist, check for regressions/conflicts, read referenced artifacts. Be interactive — present findings before starting, get buy-in on approach, allow course corrections, adapt based on current vs handoff state. Leverage handoff wisdom — pay attention to learnings section, apply documented patterns, avoid mentioned mistakes, build on discovered solutions.

**State Verification:** Never assume handoff state matches current. Verify file references exist, check for breaking changes since handoff, confirm patterns still valid. Handle scenarios: clean continuation (proceed with recommendations), diverged codebase (reconcile differences, adapt plan), incomplete work (complete unfinished first), stale handoff (re-evaluate strategy given major changes).
